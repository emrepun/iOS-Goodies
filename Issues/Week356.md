Happy Thursday! The iPhone event was on Tuesday, where Apple unveiled 4 new iPhones and HomePod mini. I'm most likely not going to upgrade my phone, as I did it last year, but I really love the blue color of the iPhone 12 and 12 mini ðŸ¤©. We also got the GM seed of Xcode 12.1, which comes with support for the new devices, also explaining why it was apparently skipped when Apple jumped to Xcode 12.2 beta after 12.0.
